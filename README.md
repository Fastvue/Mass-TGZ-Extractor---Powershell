# Mass-TGZ-Extractor---Powershell
Extract one or more TGZ files using PowerShell and 7-zip, to extract both compressed files and extract the single needed log
file.  

This tool is designed to double extract the TGZ file and pull out the single log file and place it in the desired Output log
folder for import into WebSpy Vantage.  The script is documented for which files paths can be changed and how the file name of
the log file is generated in case your log file name is different.

This was run on a Windows 2016 server.
